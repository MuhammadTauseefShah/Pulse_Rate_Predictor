***ðŸ«€ Pulse Rate Predictor***

This repository contains a machine learning project that predicts whether an individualâ€™s pulse rate indicates a potential health risk. Using the Human Vital Signs Dataset, we explore, preprocess, and model the data with four algorithms:

Logistic Regression

Random Forest

Gradient Boosting

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

The project is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook.
